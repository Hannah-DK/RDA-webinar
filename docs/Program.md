The [FAIR for Research Software](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg) (FAIR4RS) working group invites you to participate to work on community-endorsed FAIR principles for research software and encourage their adoption. There are multiple ways to [get involved](https://github.com/force11/FAIR4RS/blob/master/CommunityEngagementChannels.md), from receiving news, to co-writing, presenting outputs and leading your own events related to #FAIR4RS.

[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) is working with students, researchers, Research Software Engineers from all disciplines and national e-infrastructure partners to advance FAIRness of Software management and development practices so that research groups can collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, share and reuse their codes.

Malin Sandström is the Community Engagement officer for the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility ([INCF]( https://incf.org/)). The mission of INCF is to help make neuroscience FAIR and move it towards an open, citable ecosystem. Malin has a PhD in computational neuroscience – she did computational modelling of the olfactory system – and a MSc in engineering physics with biophysics. She works with the INCF working groups, who are mainly software tool developers and maintainers, and is engaged in the Nordic and European RSE community. She is interested in reproducibility, interoperability and reuse of scientific outputs, including software.
