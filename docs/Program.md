Choosing the right repository for your data or software is hard. The RDA working group [FAIRsharing Registry: Connecting data policies, standards and databases RDA WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/fairsharing-registry-connecting-data-policies-standards-databases.html) is working on providing users with recommendations on how to discover, select and use resources, and producers to make their resource more discoverable and cited. Since software has some special properties we are trying in the webinar to connect the work of the FAIRsharing WG to the [FAIR for Research software WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg) to start a discussion on what has been and needs to be done in regards to sharing and reusing software. We will also take a look at how you can give your software a persistent identifier that lives up to the needs of software seen as a living digital object.

Morane is a software engineer and metadata specialist on the Software Heritage team at the Inria research center, Paris, France. She has a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University Pierre et Marie Curie.  She is co-chair of the joint RDA, FORCE11 & ReSA: FAIR for Research Software Working group (FAIR4RS WG) and an active member of several working groups for Open Science and digital preservation, including: the RDA’s Software Source Code Interest Group (SSC IG), the FORCE11’s Software Citation Implementation Working Group (SCI WG) and the WikiData for Digital Preservation initiative (WikiDigi). Morane contributes to the FAIRsFAIR project where she leads the activities about FAIR software.

Malin Sandström is the Community Engagement officer for the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility ([INCF]( https://incf.org/)). The mission of INCF is to help make neuroscience FAIR and move it towards an open, citable ecosystem. Malin has a PhD in computational neuroscience – she did computational modelling of the olfactory system – and a MSc in engineering physics with biophysics. She works with the INCF working groups, who are mainly software tool developers and maintainers, and is engaged in the Nordic and European RSE community. She is interested in reproducibility, interoperability and reuse of scientific outputs, including software.
