The [FAIR for Research Software](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg) (FAIR4RS) working group invites you to participate to work on community-endorsed FAIR principles for research software and encourage their adoption. There are multiple ways to [get involved](https://github.com/force11/FAIR4RS/blob/master/CommunityEngagementChannels.md), from receiving news, to co-writing, presenting outputs and leading your own events related to #FAIR4RS.

Leyla Jael Garcia Castro is currently working as team leader for the Semantic Retrieval research team, part of the Knowledge Management Group, at ZB MED Information Centre for life sciences. Her team mainly works on literature-based information retrieval, recommendation systems, and ontology/embeddings-based search and categorization. She is a Computer Scientist interested in semantic web, linked data, data science, open science and education. She is currently involved in community projects aiming to make FAIR a reality not only for data but also for software and training materials. She has worked on software development and data integration, semantic web (mostly on named entity recognition and its linked data applications), project coordination, scientific events organization and chairing, and community-based projects (e.g., Bioschemas and BioJS). She has also worked as a university lecturer on software development and information systems.

[Radovan Bast](https://bast.fr/) is managing the [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) project which
provides training events for students, researchers, and staff from all
disciplines and national e-infrastructure partners to advance FAIRness of
software management and development practices so that research groups can
better collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, share, and reuse their
codes. He is part of the [Nordic research software engineers](https://nordic-rse.org/) community.

Malin Sandström is the Community Engagement officer for the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility ([INCF]( https://incf.org/)). The mission of INCF is to help make neuroscience FAIR and move it towards an open, citable ecosystem. Malin has a PhD in computational neuroscience – she did computational modelling of the olfactory system – and a MSc in engineering physics with biophysics. She works with the INCF working groups, who are mainly software tool developers and maintainers, and is engaged in the Nordic and European RSE community. She is interested in reproducibility, interoperability and reuse of scientific outputs, including software.
