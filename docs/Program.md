Reproducibility is an important factor playing into trustworthy research. The Knowledge Exchange report [The Art of Publishing Reproducible Research Outputs: Supporting emerging practices through cultural and technological innovation](https://zenodo.org/record/5521077#.Yihp_uiZMuU) explores the current practices and barriers for reproducibility of research outputs, with a focus on the publication and dissemination stage. the RDA working group [CURE-FAIR](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/cure-fair-wg) focusses on the specific issues that arise with software as a research output.
