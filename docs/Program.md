Reproducibility is an important factor playing into trustworthy research. The Knowledge Exchange report [The Art of Publishing Reproducible Research Outputs: Supporting emerging practices through cultural and technological innovation](https://zenodo.org/record/5521077#.Yihp_uiZMuU) explores the current practices and barriers for reproducibility of research outputs, with a focus on the publication and dissemination stage. the RDA working group [CURE-FAIR](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/cure-fair-wg) focusses on the specific issues that arise with software as a research output.

Birte Christensen-Dalsgaard is Open Science coordinator at Aarhus University and Chairman of the Data Management Advisory Forum in Danish E-infrastructure Coorporation (DeiC).

She holds a Ph.D. in Theoretical Atomic Physics and worked for 10 years as a physicist at Aarhus University. Since 1991 she has been engaged in developing research infrastructures, from HPC installation and support over digitalization of library content and digital preservation to establishing data infrastructures. She was involved in developing e-infrastructures and data management in DK and contributing to the [Danish National Strategy for Research Data Management based on the FAIR Principles](https://www.deic.dk/sites/default/files/documents/PDF/EN_National%20strategi%20for%20data%20management%20baseret%20p%C3%A5%20FAIR-principper.pdf)

She is Danish expert in Knowledge Exchange, and part of more activities including the project [publishing reproducible research output](https://www.knowledge-exchange.info/event/publishing-reproducible-research-output) with the final report [The Art of Publishing Reproducible Research Outputs: Supporting emerging practices through cultural and technological innovation 2021.](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5521077)

Limor Peer is Associate Director for Research and Strategic Initiatives at the Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS), Yale University. Limor works on research transparency and reproducibility, establishing the ISPS Data Archive and leading the project to develop YARD, a workflow tool for reviewing and enhancing research outputs. She is co-founder of the CURE (Curation for Reproducibility) Consortium of social science data archives and is co-chair of the [CURE-FAIR](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/cure-fair-wg) working group at the Research Data Alliance and the Practices working group of the ACMâ€™s Emerging Interest Group on Reproducibility and Replicability. Limor received a PhD in Communication Studies from Northwestern University.
