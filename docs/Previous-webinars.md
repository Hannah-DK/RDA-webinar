Choosing the right repository for your data or software is hard. The RDA working group [FAIRsharing Registry: Connecting data policies, standards and databases RDA WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/fairsharing-registry-connecting-data-policies-standards-databases.html) is working on providing users with recommendations on how to discover, select and use resources, and producers to make their resource more discoverable and cited. Since software has some special properties we are trying in the webinar to connect the work of the FAIRsharing WG to the [FAIR for Research software WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg) to start a discussion on what has been and needs to be done in regards to sharing and reusing software. We will also take a look at how you can give your software a persistent identifier that lives up to the needs of software seen as a living digital object.

The [FAIR for Research Software](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg) (FAIR4RS) working group will be jointly convened as an RDA Working Group, [FORCE11 Working Group](https://www.force11.org/), and a [Research Software Alliance (ReSA) Taskforce](http://www.researchsoft.org/resa-taskforces-join-us/), in recognition of the importance of this work for the advancement of the research sector. They invite you to participate to work on community-endorsed FAIR principles for research software and encourage their adoption. There are multiple ways to [get involved](https://github.com/force11/FAIR4RS/blob/master/CommunityEngagementChannels.md), from receiving news, to co-writing, presenting outputs and leading your own events related to #FAIR4RS.

Leyla Jael Garcia Castro is currently working as team leader for the Semantic Retrieval research team, part of the Knowledge Management Group, at ZB MED Information Centre for life sciences. Her team mainly works on literature-based information retrieval, recommendation systems, and ontology/embeddings-based search and categorization. She is a Computer Scientist interested in semantic web, linked data, data science, open science and education. She is currently involved in community projects aiming to make FAIR a reality not only for data but also for software and training materials. She has worked on software development and data integration, semantic web (mostly on named entity recognition and its linked data applications), project coordination, scientific events organization and chairing, and community-based projects (e.g., Bioschemas and BioJS). She has also worked as a university lecturer on software development and information systems.
