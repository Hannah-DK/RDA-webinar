We are organizing a webinar series on FAIR research software using RDA outputs and bringing their good work to the Nordic researchers. 

The first webinar will be held in Autumn 2021 and will be a general introduction. The content of the upcoming webinars will be determined by our audiences interest.

After each webinar, the material (notes and slides) are going to get uploaded here.
