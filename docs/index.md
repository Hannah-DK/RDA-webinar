The [Danish](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-denmark) and [Swedish](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-sweden) RDA nodes decided have started a webinar series to bring outputs and the good work from RDA to the Nordics. Our main goal is to improve research and increase the network by inviting RDA groups to present their work. <br/>

As a starting point we have decided to begin our webinar series with the topic of FAIR research software. How to make software FAIR and how to store it is in certain aspects heavily overlapping with the [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) in others unique definitions and practices are necessary. In the [first webinar](https://rda-software-webinar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Previous-webinars/) we focused on the basic differences between data and software, outputs of the [RDA FAIR4RS working group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg) and the experiences within the Nordic Region. The second webinar will have a focus on repositories in general and what specifications need to be considered for software. 

The topics of the upcoming webinars will be influenced by the participants.
