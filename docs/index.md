Since the funding for the national RDA nodes under the [RDA Europe 4.0 project](https://grants.rd-alliance.org/) ran out, the members of the previous [Danish](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-denmark) and [Swedish](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-sweden) RDA nodes decided that they still want to bring the outputs and good work of RDA to the Nordic region. Our main goal is to enhance research and increase networking. 

To do so, we are organizing a webinar series on FAIR research software.
