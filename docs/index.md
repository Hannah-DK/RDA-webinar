The [Danish](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-denmark) and [Swedish](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-sweden) RDA nodes decided have started a webinar series to bring outputs and the good work from RDA to the Nordics. Our main goal is to improve research and increase the network by inviting RDA groups to present their work. <br/>

In the first two webinars, we focussed on [the difference between data and software](https://rda-software-webinar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Previous-webinars/#fair-research-software-30082021) in regards to [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and the [specific requirements for software repositories](https://rda-software-webinar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Previous-webinars/#standards-and-best-practice-recommendations-for-software-repositories-05112021).

This webinar will be the last one in our series about software and we will have interesting talks about how to make research outputs reproducible and what specific rules apply for software.
