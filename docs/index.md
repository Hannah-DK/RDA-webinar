The [Danish](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-denmark) and [Swedish](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-sweden) RDA nodes decided have started a webinar series to bring outputs and the good work from RDA to the Nordics. Our main goal is to improve research and increase the network by inviting RDA groups to present their work. <br/>

Our webinar series about Research Software is finnished now. Our work on bringing the outputs of RDA to the Nordics will continue. You will find more information here shortly.

The material (notes, slides and recordings) are uploaded here under [Previous Webinars](https://rda-software-webinar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Previous-webinars/).

If you have any questions, please contact [Hannah Mihai](mailto:Hannah.Mihai@deic.dk) or [Martin Brandhagen](mailto:martin.brandhagen@gu.se) for additional information!
