Since the funding for the national RDA nodes under the [RDA Europe 4.0 project](https://grants.rd-alliance.org/) ran out, the members of the previous [Danish](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-denmark) and [Swedish](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-sweden) RDA nodes decided that they still want to bring the outputs and good work of RDA to the Nordic region. Our main goal is to enhance research and increase networking. <br/>

As a starting point we have decided to begin our webinar series with the topic of FAIR research software. How to make software FAIR is in certain aspects heavily overlapping with the [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) in others unique definitions and practices are necessary. In the first webinar we want to focus on the basic differences between data and software, outputs of the [RDA FAIR4RS working group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg) and the experiences within the Nordic Region.

The topics of the upcoming webinars will be influenced by the participants.
